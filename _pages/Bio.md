I am a principal researcher at [Tencent ARC Lab](https://arc.tencent.com/en/index), where I lead an effort on 3D digitization and immersive content creation. **We are actively looking for research interns** to work on related research topics, including but not limited to 3D reconstruction, novel view synthesis, 3D generation, and shape analysis; please feel free to reach out if you are interested.

Previously, I worked as a senior research engineer at Y-tech, [Kuaishou Technology](https://www.kuaishou.com/en). Before that, I was the CTO of [Owlii](https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/171393-49) (acquired by Kuaishou).

I did my PhD at [Graphics and Geometric Computing Group](https://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), where I was advised by [Prof. Shi-Min Hu](https://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/shimin.htm). During my PhD, I spent a semester as a visiting PhD student at [Computer Graphics Group](https://www.graphics.rwth-aachen.de/), RWTH Aachen University, advised by [Prof. Leif Kobbelt](https://www.graphics.rwth-aachen.de/person/3/). Earlier, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Tsinghua University.
